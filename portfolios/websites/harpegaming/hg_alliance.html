    <h3><font color="white">Decide the Fate of the World</font></h3>
    <font face="verdana" size="3" color="white">
    <p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
      the outcome. As one of the world powers 
      battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
      military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
      You have to form alliances and then betray your 
      allies before they betray you!</p>
    <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
      of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
      raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
      with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
      move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
      the conflict.</p>
    <p>The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
      Buy armaments and develop secret 
      weapons from your country's economic funds and 
      natural reserves, but be sure to save 
      something for the future.</p>

    <h3><div id="subtitle">Tedious and Confusing</div></h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.example.com/bgreview">
    <font face="verdana" size="3" color="white"><p>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
      share similar features including the 
      formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
      through random draws of a deck or the 
      roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
      is new or innovative in that regard.</p>
    <p>We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
      In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
      reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
      playing the game. If you want to read a 
      book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p>

    <h3><div id="subtitle">Decent Game but Many are Better</div></h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.example.com/tacticstrials">
    <font face="verdana" size="3" color="white"><p>Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
      game play to be robust and engaging. The 
      rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
      experience in this class of board games, there 
      is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
      think the battle simulation cards are some of 
      the best we have encountered.</p>
    <p>All of that being said, the competition for this type 
      of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
      established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
      exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
      that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
      to draw our attention away from games like 
      Battle Tested and Global Conflict.</p>

    <h3><div id="subtitle">Fun and Challenging</div></h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.example.com/leisureroom">
    <font face="verdana" size="3" color="white"><p>Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
      war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
      ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
      investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p>
    <p><em>Things We Liked</em>
    <ul><li>Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
    <li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
    <li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
    <li>Wealth of Expansion Packs</ul></p>
    <p><em>Things We Hated</em>
    <ul><li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
    <li>Setup takes too Long</li></ul></p>
    <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored.</p>
