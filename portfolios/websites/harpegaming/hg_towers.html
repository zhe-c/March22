    <h3>Rule an Ancient City</h3>

    <font face="verdana" size="3"><p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
      Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
      Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
      Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
      the administration of a city. Each role provides 
      a different ability and strategy. However, 
      one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
      must be constantly aware of betrayal 
      and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
      of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
      and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
    <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
      carefully choose his or her roles and 
      the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
      of a card. However the level of randomness is 
      just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
      overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
      recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
      players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
      and some of the game appeal.</p>

    <font face="verdana" size="3"><p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
      just about perfect and each player must 
      carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
      strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
      the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
      high and gets even better when you replace 
      some of the cards with new cards available in the 
      expansion packs.</p>

    <h3><div id="subtitle">Great Strategic Board Game</div></h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.example.com/gamersshop">
    <font face="verdana" size="3"><p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
      to 6 players and we can strongly 
      recommend the game. The different phases of the 
      game are interesting and intriguing, from
      bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
      With the variety of cards and 
      scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
      a great introduction to the world of 
      strategic board games and role playing.</p>

    <h3><div id="subtitle">An Incredible Game</div></h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.example.com/tacticstrials">
    <font face="verdana" size="3"><p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
      and one of the best around. As 
      for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
      are tough decisions to make every 
      turn. It's not only important to select the character 
      that increases your chances for scoring, 
      but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
      are likely to select, and then hedge against 
      their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
      and deep strategic thinking. However, 
      it can still be played at a more basic level for 
      younger users.</p>
    <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
      Best in its Class. Highly recommended.</p>
